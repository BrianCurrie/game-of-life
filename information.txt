== Conway's Game of Life ==

----------------------------
History

In 1970 during teatime at Cambridge University British mathematician 
John Horton Conway devised a simple game using only a Go board and four rules.
This game, later being dubbed the "Game of Life", would end up having implications
in mathematics, computer science, biology, economics, physics, and philosophy.


-Game of life is turing complete
-Halting problem says there is no algorithm for determining if game of life will
go on forever or die of

-Conway died on April 11th 2020 at the age of 82 due to complications from COVID-19

----------------------------
Game rules in simple terms:

The Game of Life is played on a grid with each cell being "alive" or "dead".
A player determins the original state of the grid, after which four rules govern
the subsequent generations:

1. A dead cell has exactly 3 living neighbors it will come back to life

2. A living cell with exactly 2 or 3 living neighbors will stay alive

3. A living cell with less than 2 living neighbors will die

4. A living cell with 3 or more living neighbors will die

Basic paterns to demonstrate rules:

Stable patterns:
    Square 2x2

Repeating patterns:
    Blinker 1x3

Glider:
    Classic glider
